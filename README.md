# cpm: A container package manager

cpm is a command line tool for using container technology
to run command line applications. Instead of installing, 
running and managing native binaries for your device 
(as is the case with homebrew or apt), cpm allows using 
OCI images to use any cli-application regardless of the 
operating system.
